# Hi, I‚Äôm Jake Simpson

I‚Äôm a second-year Electrical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, where I focus on the intersection of technology and finance. Over two co-op terms at **Nokia**, I gained hands-on experience automating network tasks, scripting in Python/Bash, and building front-end tools (with YAML) for network simulations.

Outside the classroom and lab, I‚Äôm fascinated by **AI, blockchain, and the evolving landscape of automation**. I enjoy tackling technical challenges, optimizing workflows, and exploring how financial systems might adapt to emerging tech.
